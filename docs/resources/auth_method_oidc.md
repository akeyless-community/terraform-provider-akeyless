Whenever a user logs in with a token, these authentication types issue a sub claim that contains details uniquely identifying that user. This sub claim includes a key containing the ID value that you configured, and is used to distinguish between different users from within the same organization.

- `delete_protection` (String) Protection from accidental deletion of this auth method, [true/false]
- `force_sub_claims` (Boolean) enforce role-association must include sub claims
